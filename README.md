- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JuanFarrellP, a fresh mathematics graduate from Institute Technology Bandung.
- ðŸ“˜ Through my pursuit of a bachelor's degree in mathematics, I discovered my enthusiasm for coding. Python and MATLAB were the programming languages I used for my class assignments and final project.
- ðŸ‘€ As of late, Iâ€™ve been interested in Web/Mobile Development.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m still searching for programming languages and frameworks that suit me.
- ðŸ“« You can reach me by sending an email to juanfarrell.work@gmail.com.
